Mod of Report the temperature with ESP8266 to MQTT by https://github.com/balloob
Paul uploaded to the HA blog (https://home-assistant.io/blog/2015/10/11/measure-temperature-with-esp8266-and-report-to-mqtt/) how to do this with a Adafruit HDC1008 Temperature & Humidity Sensor  but I did not have one of those, what I did have was a DHT22 sensor laying around.

Paul's article was very helpful.

here are my mods. hope they help someone.
